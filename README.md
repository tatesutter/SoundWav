# SoundWav

## Description
SoundWav is an application for users to save shared Sound Cloud playlists from friends. Sound Cloud currently supports users having the ability to create a playlist and share with friends, but you must save a link to the address or navigate around in a clunky way. SoundWav allows users to create an account, add the playlist or share it, and itâ€™s saved to your account.

## Licensing
There are no licenses required to use this application.

## Installation
- Open Visual Studio on your local computer.
